# FaceTool (before: FacebookLikes)
## Purpose
Users who are long time in Facebook have liked pages over the time. As time passes, people change and tastes change.
For some people it would be easy to unlike pages if the amount is manageable, but for others who have more than a thousand pages liked, it becomes a very slow and tedious process.
This webapp tries to solve that problem

## Development
This project was originally developed using Django, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Facebook Graph API (see `/webapp`). After a while of this project collecting dust, I decided to make it a React project by using some tools learned in a work term (see `frontend`). However, Facebook doesn't allow "unlikes" by using their API anymore, which sadly makes this project obsolete. Other features and uses can be added to this project, but for now, I'm going to use it as reference and practice

### TO-DO
- More features
- Better UI
